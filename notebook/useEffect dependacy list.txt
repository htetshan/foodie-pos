  /* 
  useEffect Rendering
useEffect(() => { ... }, [menuCategory]) — What Triggers It?
This useEffect runs every time menuCategory changes — regardless of whether it becomes:

A defined value ({name: "drinks"})

Or undefined

So:

✅ Initial render — menuCategory is likely undefined, and effect runs.

✅ API call completes, menuCategory becomes { name: "drinks" } → effect runs.

✅ Later, for some reason, menuCategory is set back to undefined → effect runs again.

Each time the menuCategory value (reference) changes — even between undefined → object or object → undefined — the useEffect will re-run. */
